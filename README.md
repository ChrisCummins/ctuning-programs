Shared programs, benchmarks and kernels for autotuning/crowd-tuning
===================================================================

Various public benchmarks and kernels that we used in our research on
universal and multi-objective autotuning/crowd-tuning. It is possible
to reproduce and extend some techniques from our recent papers:

* http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06256
* http://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054763
* https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00436029
* http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4075

We envision that community will join us in sharing their programs and data sets
to enable systematic, collaborative and reproducible computer engineering.
