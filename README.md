Shared programs, benchmarks and kernels for crowd-tuning and crowd-benchmarking via CK
======================================================================================

Various public bechmarks and kernels in CK format used in our research on 
universal and multi-objective autotuning/and crowd-tuning. It is possible
to reproduce and extend some techniques from our recent papers:

* http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06256
* http://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054763
* https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00436029
* http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4075

We hope that community will also start sharing their programs and data sets
in a universal format to enable systematic, collaborative and reproducible
computer engineering.
